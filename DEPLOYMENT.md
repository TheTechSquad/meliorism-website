# Vercel Deployment Guide

This project is now configured for successful deployment on Vercel.

## üéØ Key Fixes Applied

### 1. Package Lock File Synchronization
- **Problem**: `npm ci` was failing due to TypeScript version mismatch between `package.json` and `package-lock.json`
- **Solution**: Regenerated `package-lock.json` to ensure perfect sync

### 2. Vercel Configuration Optimization
- **Problem**: Old-style builds configuration was inefficient for monorepo
- **Solution**: Updated `vercel.json` with modern deployment settings:
  - Direct build command specification
  - Proper output directory configuration
  - Enhanced routing for SPA support

### 3. Asset Path Configuration
- **Problem**: Absolute asset paths could cause issues in deployment
- **Solution**: Added `"homepage": "."` to ensure relative asset paths

### 4. Node.js Version Specification
- **Problem**: No engine specification could lead to version conflicts
- **Solution**: Added Node.js 18.x engine specification in root `package.json`

## üöÄ Deployment Process

The deployment now follows this optimized process:

1. **Install**: `npm install` (root level)
2. **Build**: `npm run build` ‚Üí builds React frontend with `npm ci && npm run build`
3. **Deploy**: Serves static files from `frontend/build/`

## üìÅ Configuration Files

- **`vercel.json`**: Modern Vercel configuration with SPA routing
- **`.vercelignore`**: Excludes unnecessary files (node_modules, docs, etc.)
- **`package.json`**: Root build scripts and Node.js version
- **`frontend/package.json`**: React app with proper homepage setting

## ‚úÖ Testing

To verify the configuration works:

```bash
# Test the exact build process Vercel will use
npm run build

# Check output directory
ls -la frontend/build/

# Verify asset paths are relative
cat frontend/build/index.html | grep -E "(src|href)="
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

If deployment still fails:

1. **Check Vercel build logs** for specific error messages
2. **Verify environment variables** if your app uses any (add in Vercel dashboard)
3. **Test locally** with the exact commands Vercel uses
4. **Node version**: Ensure your local environment matches the specified version

## üìã Deployment Checklist

- [x] Package files synchronized (`package.json` ‚Üî `package-lock.json`)
- [x] Modern Vercel configuration (`vercel.json`)
- [x] SPA routing configured for all routes
- [x] Relative asset paths for deployment
- [x] Node.js version specified (18.x)
- [x] Unnecessary files excluded (`.vercelignore`)
- [x] Build process tested and verified

Your Meliorism Foundation website should now deploy successfully on Vercel! üéâ
